Build a machine learning model to accurately classify whether or not the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not?	


You will be evaluated on how well you perform the following steps:
	Missing data handling
	Data Preprocessing (with an explanation of why you are doing that particular step).
	Exploratory Data Analysis
	Features Extraction
	Model building
	Code Commenting
	Documentation

What to submit:
	A python file or Jupyter File with code and comments.
	Detailed documentation of all the steps and results.  

Submission details : 
	Compress all the files and submit the compressed file with name as RollNo1_RollNo2_RollNo3.zip 
	Send the compressed file to 'iiitb.ml.2019@gmail.com' with Subject as Assignemnt_1_RollNo1_RollNo2_RollNo3 
	Deadline : 11:59:00 PM 15th Septemnber 2019 

Some details about the dataset:

     Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant

     Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test

     BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)

     SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)

     Insulin:2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)

     BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)

     DiabetesPedigreeFunction:
          It provided some data on diabetes mellitus history in relatives and the genetic relationship of those relatives to the patient. This measure of genetic influence gives an idea of the hereditary risk one might have with the onset of diabetes mellitus.

Note:
	Maximum size of the group is 3. 
	Late submission of the assignment will result in marks deduction.
